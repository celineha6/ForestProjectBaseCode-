# ForestProjectBaseCode
This is the base code for the project. All the functions are written in the file called functions and works the way it should. However, the point of this project is to turn this unsophisticated level of coding into a cleaner and more cohesive project by creating classes for each entity for a more object oriented style of programming in java.
